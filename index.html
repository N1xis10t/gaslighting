                The following text is called the Forstmyer-Grendleson
                sentence, after the two psychologists who discovered
                its effects; Hans Forstmyer and Fritz Grendleson. It
                is a somewhat curious sentence, in that its benign and
                ambiguous phrasing makes it function very similarly to
                a rorschach test. Give it a read!

                How did <em>your</em> mind interperet the sentence? 
                Was it insightful? An interesting thing about the
                Forstmyer-Grendleson sentence is that upon re-reading
                it closely, most subjects are capable of recognizing
                how benign and uninteresting it actually is.
